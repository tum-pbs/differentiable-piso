        A multigrid solver first solves the pressure on a lower-resolution grid and successively upsamples and refines it.
        On each grid, i, the pressure is calculated using the i-th provided PressureSolver.
        The resulting pressure is then upsampled and given as initial guess to the next level.

        This approach reduces the number of high-resolution iterations required, especially if the previous solver had a higher accuracy.
